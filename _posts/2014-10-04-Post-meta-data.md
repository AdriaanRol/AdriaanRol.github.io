This post describes the type of meta data that should be in. I will probably edit this post a few times. 

Currently I envision several types of meta data that will be used. 

 **layout**: determines which jekyll layout template is used. 
'post' is currently the only one used. 

**title**, speaks for itself  
**date**, idem. 

**tags**: tags that make it easier to find back certain notes. Need to compile a list of frequently used tags. Ideally I find a balance between specific and general tags so as not to have to many or to few. 

**category**: Single entry, will determine in the future what kind of layout /website to use for it and is used to seperate different types of posts. I currently envision 3 different categories, of which this one is seperate. 

*   Science_n_Technology 
*   Creative_n_Humanities
*   Tools_n_Techniques 

the_n_ is there because jekyll doesn't like the & in the metadata
