Stumbled on this http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/330/what-are-good-ways-to-document-scientific-software  post about documenting scientific programming. 

Altough I am leaning towards github documentation something like pydoc might be better suited/simpler. Worth looking into a bit further.
